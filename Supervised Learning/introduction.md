**Training:** Given training examples {(Xi, Yi)} where Xi is the feature vector and Yi the target variable, learn a function F to best firt the training data (i.e., Yi ~ F(Xi) âˆ€ i)

Takeaways:

- identify problem, collect data and extract features

- model the mapping from input to output variables

training sample entirely could be different from what we gonna get in test the data.

Types of supervision.

- *Classification: Y is categorical*
- *Regression: Y is numeric*

Linear models, Tree based models, Neural Networks, Other supervised models.
